ImVec2      SelectableTextAlign;        // Alignment of selectable text. Defaults to (0.0f, 0.0f) (top-left aligned). It's generally important to keep this left-aligned if you want to lay multiple items on a same line.

ImVec2      DisplaySafeAreaPadding;     // If you cannot see the edges of your screen (e.g. on a TV) increase the safe area padding. Apply to popups/tooltips as well regular windows. NB: Prefer configuring your TV sets correctly!

float       CurveTessellationTol;       // Tessellation tolerance when using PathBezierCurveTo() without a specific number of segments. Decrease for highly tessellated curves (higher quality, more polygons), increase to reduce quality.
float       CircleTessellationMaxError; // Maximum error (in pixels) allowed when using AddCircle()/AddCircleFilled() or drawing rounded corner rectangles with no explicit segment count specified. Decrease for higher quality but more geometry.
